				<h2>Natural Disasters are dangerous</h2>
				<p>
					While there are numerous natural disasters, this website contains a few of them such as floods, earthquakes, and wildfires.
					Natural disasters cause on average 60,000 deaths per year. However, over the past few decades, the deaths from natural disasters
					have started to decline. The decline is impressive considering the increase in population growth in the past few decades.
