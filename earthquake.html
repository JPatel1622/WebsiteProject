				<h3>What is an earthquake?</h3>
				<p>
					An earthquake is caused by the release of energy that is stored in the Earth's crust. The release of energy causes seismic waves causing the surface of the Earth to shake. 
					The U.S. suffers dozens of earthquakes each year causing power outages, fires, lack of water supply, property damage, and deaths. 
				</p>
				<h3>How to prepare for an earthquake?</h3>
				<p>
					To prepare for an earthquake, you should know the signs of an earthquake. If you hear a roaring sound, a rolling sensation, or are jarred by a jolt, an earthquake is coming.
					Many objects are bound to fall and building materials are going to collapse, so learn the safe spots in each room of your house. Drop onto your knees and hands, cover your head
					and neck under a table until the shaking stops. If there is too much property damage, you may need to evacuate. Always have an exit plan to safely leave your home, prepare an
					emergency kit with food, first aid kit, and other essentials.
